A **GitHub Action** for creating a **GitHub Release** with **Assets** and **Changelog** whenever a new **Tag** is pushed to the repository.  

![PIC](docs/images/release.png)

## Features:
- Parse Tag to match Semantic Versioning
- Upload build artifacts (assets) to the release
- Add a changelog to the release
- Linux/Windows runners supported
- Filename pattern matching

## Manual:
1. Add changes to `CHANGELOG.md` in the following format (according to [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ "Keep a ChangeLog")):
```
## [3.1.0-rc.1] - 2019-12-21 
### Added
- Feature A
- Feature B
- GitHub Actions as a CI system
- GitHub Release as an Artifactory system

### Changed
- User API

### Removed
- Previous CI build
- Previous Artifactory
```
2. Tag a commit with Version (according to [semver.org](https://semver.org/ "Semantic Versioning")).
3. Push and watch **Git-Release** publishing a Release on GitHub ;-)

## Configuration:
1. Change the workflow to be triggered on Tag Push:
    - For example `'*'` or a more specific like `'v*'`:
```
on:
  push:
    tags:
    - 'v*'
```
2. Add Release step to your workflow:  
```
    - name: Release
      uses: docker://antonyurchenko/git-release:latest
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        DRAFT_RELEASE: "false"
        PRE_RELEASE: "false"
        CHANGELOG_FILE: "CHANGELOG.md"
        ALLOW_EMPTY_CHANGELOG: "false"
        ALLOW_TAG_PREFIX: "true"
      with:
        args: |
            build/*-amd64.zip
```

<details><summary>:information_source: All Configuration Options</summary>

- Provide a list of assets as `args` (divided by one of: `new line`, `space`, `comma`, `pipe`)
- `DRAFT_RELEASE (true/false as string)` - Save release as draft instead of publishing it (default `false`).
- `PRE_RELEASE (true/false as string)` - GitHub will point out that this release is identified as non-production ready (default: `false`). 
- `CHANGELOG_FILE (string)` - Changelog filename (default: `CHANGELOG.md`).
  - set to `none` in order to completely ignore changelog.
- `ALLOW_EMPTY_CHANGELOG (true/false as string)` - Allow publishing a release without changelog (default `false`).
- `ALLOW_TAG_PREFIX (true/false as string)` - Allow prefix on version Tag, for example `v3.2.0` or `release-3.2.0` (default: `false`).
- `RELEASE_NAME (string)` - Complete release title (may not be combined with PREFIX or POSTFIX).
- `RELEASE_NAME_PREFIX (string)` - Release title prefix.
- `RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX (string)` - Release title postfix.

</details>  

<details><summary>:information_source: Windows Runners</summary>

Execute **git-release** through JavaScrip Wrapper on Windows Runners.

Example:
```
    - name: Release
      uses: anton-yurchenko/git-release@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        DRAFT_RELEASE: "false"
        PRE_RELEASE: "false"
        CHANGELOG_FILE: "CHANGELOG.md"
        ALLOW_EMPTY_CHANGELOG: "false"
        ALLOW_TAG_PREFIX: "true"
      with:
        args: |
            build/darwin-amd64.zip
            build/linux-amd64.zip
            build/windows-amd64.zip
```

</details>

:information_source: [Configuration Examples](docs/example.md#examples)

## Remarks:
- **Git Tag** should be identical to **Changelog Version** in order for changes to be parsed properly. This does not include **Tag Prefix** like `v*`.
- This action is automatically built at **Docker Hub**, and tagged with `latest / v3 / v3.3 / v3.3.0`. You may lock to a certain version instead of using **latest**.  
(*Recommended to lock against a major version, for example* `v3`)
- Instead of using a pre-built Docker image, you may execute the action through JavaScript wrapper by changing `docker://antonyurchenko/git-release:latest` to `anton-yurchenko/git-release@master`
