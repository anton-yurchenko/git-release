## [3.0.1] - 2020-01-08
### Fixed
- Empty release name

## [3.0.0] - 2020-01-05
This is a major release because of a certain behavior change:  
- *Tag (without prefix) should be identical to Changelog Version in order for changes to be mapped (for example tag `v3.0.0-rc.1` is expected to be listed as `3.0.0-rc.1` in changelog).*
- *By default valid semver version is expected. Prefix should be explicitly allowed by enabling `ALLOW_TAG_PREFIX`*

### Changed
- Better `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` regex validation
- Improved **Changelog** package parsing capabilities
- Tag should match Changelog Version (excluding prefix)

### Fixed
- Semantic Versioning compliance
- Keep a Changelog compliance

### Added
- `ALLOW_TAG_PREFIX` to control version prefix like `v` or `release`

## [2.0.0] - 2019-12-28
